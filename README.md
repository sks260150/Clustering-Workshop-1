### **Introduction to Cluster Computing and Distributed Programming with LXD**"

### **Target Audience**: 4th Semester Computer Science Engineering Students

### **Duration**: 2 Days (12 hours total)

---

### **Day 1: Foundations**
#### **Session 1: Introduction to Linux (2 hours)**
- **Objective**: Familiarize students with Linux, Bash, and basic shell scripting.
- **Content**:
  - What is Linux?
    - Overview of Linux distributions.
    - Key concepts: kernel, shell, terminal.
  - Basic Linux commands:
    - Navigation (cd, ls, pwd).
    - File management (cp, mv, rm, mkdir, chmod, chown).
    - Package management (apt, snap).
  - Introduction to Bash scripting:
    - Variables, conditionals (if-else), loops (for, while).
    - Creating and running a simple script.

- **Hands-on**:
  - Write a Bash script that backs up a directory.
  - Write a script that automates software updates on a system.

#### **Session 2: Introduction to Cluster Computing (1 hour)**
- **Objective**: Explain the concept of cluster computing.
- **Content**:
  - What is cluster computing?
    - High-performance computing (HPC) and its applications.
  - Types of clusters: Load balancing, high availability, parallel computing.
  - Introduction to distributed computing concepts.

#### **Session 3: Introduction to LXD (1 hour)**
- **Objective**: Get students acquainted with LXD for containerization and clustering.
- **Content**:
  - What is LXD?
    - LXC vs. LXD.
  - Why use containers for clustering?
  - Basic LXD commands:
    - Installation and setup.
    - Creating containers, managing images.
    - Networking and storage in LXD.

- **Hands-on**:
  - Install LXD on each studentâ€™s laptop.
  - Create a simple Ubuntu container and run a basic command inside the container.

### **Day 2: Building and Working with Clusters**
#### **Session 4: Creating an LXD Cluster (2 hours)**
- **Objective**: Demonstrate how to create a cluster using Ubuntu laptops.
- **Content**:
  - Setting up LXD on multiple systems.
  - Introduction to cluster networking concepts.
  - Connecting Ubuntu laptops in a cluster using LXD.
  - Configuring LXD nodes for clustering.
  - Understanding distributed file systems and network communication.

- **Hands-on**:
  - Each student configures their laptop as a node in the cluster.
  - Create a simple 3-node cluster with peer-to-peer communication.
  - Test connectivity and container migration between nodes.

#### **Session 5: Distributed Programming Concepts (2 hours)**
- **Objective**: Teach distributed programming paradigms and design patterns.
- **Content**:
  - Parallel vs. distributed programming.
  - Programming models: Message Passing Interface (MPI), MapReduce.
  - Overview of problem-solving in distributed systems.
  - Distributed task execution strategies.

- **Hands-on**:
  - Simple Python distributed program using `multiprocessing` and `socket`.
  - Write a program that sends a task to multiple nodes for processing and aggregates results.

#### **Session 6: Problem Distribution on the Cluster (2 hours)**
- **Objective**: Solve a real-world problem using the cluster.
- **Problem**: Word counting in a large set of text files distributed across the cluster.
  
  **Steps**:
  1. Divide a large file into chunks.
  2. Distribute the chunks to different containers in the cluster.
  3. Use a distributed program to count words in each chunk on separate nodes.
  4. Aggregate the results from all nodes and display the final count.

- **Hands-on**:
  - Students work in teams, setting up the problem, writing the code, distributing tasks, and gathering results from the cluster.
  - Debugging and troubleshooting any issues during distribution.

### **Wrap-up (1 hour)**:
- **Q&A session** on cluster computing, distributed programming, and LXD.
- Discuss the potential of cluster computing in future projects and industry applications.
- Feedback and take-home assignment: Explore fault tolerance in LXD clustering.

---

### **Prerequisites**:
- Students should have basic knowledge of programming (C, Python).
- **Book**: [The Linux Command Line](https://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php)
  - This book is for new Linux users who have migrated from other platforms.
  - **PLEASE READ CHAPTERS 1-5 OF THIS BOOK, YOU WILL THANK ME IN THE WORKSHOP**
 

This workshop is designed to give students hands-on experience with Linux, LXD clustering, and distributed programming, preparing them for more advanced topics in parallel computing and cloud technologies.
