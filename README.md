  - Simple Python distributed program using `multiprocessing` and `socket`.
  - Write a program that sends a task to multiple nodes for processing and aggregates results.

#### **Session 6: Problem Distribution on the Cluster (2 hours)**
- **Objective**: Solve a real-world problem using the cluster.
- **Problem**: Word counting in a large set of text files distributed across the cluster.
  
  **Steps**:
  1. Divide a large file into chunks.
  2. Distribute the chunks to different containers in the cluster.
  3. Use a distributed program to count words in each chunk on separate nodes.
  4. Aggregate the results from all nodes and display the final count.

- **Hands-on**:
  - Students work in teams, setting up the problem, writing the code, distributing tasks, and gathering results from the cluster.
  - Debugging and troubleshooting any issues during distribution.
